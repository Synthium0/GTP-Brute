# GTP-Brute
A brute force script for guessthepin.com written in python

I found this code on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/73340727), and made a few changes, such as a execution timer, and a more compact progress bar.

## Getting Started
To start, you should first ensure that the correct modules are installed
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, Start the brute force!
```
python main.py
```
